# LDheat with large datasets

Peter L. Morrell
16 August 2013

This combination of an R script and a shell script will slice up a date set and then create an LDheatmap plot. A sample data file nucleotide format is included. A file demonstrating the format for the genetic map is also included.

The shell script is necessary for queuing. The R script is quite manual; 
the user has to specify chromosome and the type of LD plot.
