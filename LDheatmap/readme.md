# LDheatmap with large datasets

This combination of an R script and a shell script will slice up a date set and create an LDheatmap plot. A sample data file in nucleotide format is included. Afile demonstrating the format for the genetic map is also included.

The shell script is necessary for queuing. The R script is quite manual; 
the user has to specify chromosome and the type of LD plot.

This is old, but relatively useful code. Don't know why I never made it avaiable!
